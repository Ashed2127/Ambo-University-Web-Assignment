       <h3>What is Computer Science?</h3>
<p>
Computer science is the study of computers, 
including computational theory, hardware and software design, 
algorithms and the way humans interact with technology.
    </p>
    
    <p>Computer scientists are problem solvers. 
        When a computer scientist receives a problem, 
        they gather information and communicate with computers using programming languages 
        and logic (e.g. scripting). They create a set of rules or instructions for the 
        computer to execute and solve the problem. Read on to learn more about 
        what computer science is, the importance and benefits of computer science, 
        professional tools and resources, and how to pursue a career in computer science.</p><br>
    
    <h3>What is the Importance of Computer Science?</h3>
    <p>Even when we think we’ve “unplugged” from society, 
        there are devices running in the background throughout our
         homes and in our neighborhoods. It’s safe to say we live in a world that
          relies heavily on technology. In this society, two types of people have emerged: 
          those who let technology run their lives and those who create technology that
           changes lives. Which side would you rather be on?</p>

      <p>  Computer scientists solve complex problems such as predicting 
        natural disasters, mapping viral outbreak patterns, improving our 
        health care system and making education accessible. For example, 
        online education was something people once scoffed at, and now, people 
        can learn almost anything online from YouTube tutorials to free learning platforms,
         such as Khan Academy.</p>
<br>

         <h3>What are the Benefits of Computer Science?</h3>
         <p>Most companies are tech companies in some capacity,
          whether it’s a brick-and-mortar retailer moving into 
          the e-commerce space or using an app to get your favorite food delivered to
           your door, computer science technology has improved our access so that almost 
           anything we want is at our fingertips. Salary may depend on experience and industry,
            but the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reports a median pay of $110,140 per year
             or $52.95 per hour.
         
         According to the BLS, there were 1,847,900 jobs for software developers in 2020External 
         link:open_in_new, which includes applications and systems software developers. 
         The field is expected to grow 22% between 2020 and 2030, which is more than two times 
         faster than the average growth for the U.S. job market.
         
         Clearly, there’s a need for computer science-related technical skills as companies upgrade 
         their business models. A career in computer science, especially software development, is an
          innovative space and can be exciting work for those who enjoy lifelong learning.</p>

         <h3>Computer Science Tools & Resources</h3>
         <p>At this point you may be wondering where to start. What tools will you be using, what do you 
         learn in computer science, and are there resources that can help you get started?
         
         A well known site called The Odin ProjectExternal link:open_in_new offers a free computer science 
         course complete with tutorials, blogs and a helpful community. As you start your journey, you’ll 
         run into StackOverflowExternal link:open_in_new, a question-and-answer site helping novice and 
         experienced programmers discover solutions and conne
         ct with their peers.</p>
